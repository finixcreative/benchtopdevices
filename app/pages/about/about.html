		<p>Thank you for your interest in TV News Sales Co., Inc. PLEASE READ ALL THE INFORMATION LISTED BELOW THOROUGHLY AND CAREFULLY. Feel free to call with any questions <a href="tel:1-800-692-2067">(800) 692-2067</a>.</p>
		<h4>ABOUT OUR COMPANY</h4>
		<p>TV News Sales Co. has been in business since 1957. We are a family business, now on our second generation.</p>
		<h4>HOW OUR COMPANY WORKS</h4>
		<p>We are called “direct wholesalers” which means that you will receive all the publications you want to carry directly from the publisher's printing plants via US Mail or UPS. TV News Sales Co. does not do the shipping, the publishers do. We do the ordering, billing, and returns for the publishers.</p>
		<h4>HOW TO ORDER</h4>
		<p>In Publications you can view all the titles we offer. Follow the provided directions at the top of the page to print and fill out our order form. The titles you carry are up to you - you can carry one title or all of them - it is your choice. After filling out the form, mail or fax it to us (be sure to send us all pages even if you do not select anything from one of them), along with the completed and signed credit application. You will receive an acknowledgement letter within 7 days of when we receive your order. If you do not receive this acknowledgement letter, call us to be sure we received the order.</p>
		<h4>HOW TO PAY</h4>
		<p>You will receive an invoice from us at the end of each month. All titles that are now off sale will be listed on your invoice. You will deduct all unsold magazines directly off your invoice. You will only pay us only for magazines that you have sold. It is a great consignment program. The invoice is sent in duplicate; you must send us the top white copy and payment for all magazines sold and unsold headings (see below).</p>
		<h4>TERMS</h4>
		<p>All invoices are due back net 25 days from invoice date, no exceptions. Your discount is 20-30% off cover. The discount is already included on your invoice. There are no delivery fees, service fees, or hidden costs.</p>
		<h4>HANDLING UNSOLD MAGAZINES</h4>
		<p>The great news is, you do not have to return all unsold magazines. In order to issue credit, we do require a small portion of the front cover from every unsold magazine showing the magazine name and issue date (we will send you a copy of what needs to be returned included in the acknowledgement letter), and you must destroy the rest of the magazine.</p>
		<h4>GETTING STARTED</h4>
		<p>Due to the fact that we do not do the shipping, we must order in advance from the publishers. They have to complete their orders very early. It will take approximately 5-6 weeks to receive your weekly titles and 3 issues to receive your monthly issues. It sounds like a long time but you have to remember all monthly titles are on-sale the month before (ex: January issues are on sale in December). Please realize that we cannot get you started immediately. It takes time, but once you start receiving your titles you will receive them regularly.</p>
		<h4>MAGAZINE DISPLAY OPTIONS</h4>
		<p>We will provide one 20-pocket display free of charge if you order twenty (20) or more different titles (Unfortunately if you discontinue service within one year you will be responsible for full payment of rack). We also offer a "sophisticate 15 pocket display" free of charge. If you meet either of these minimum order requirements and would like to receive a free rack with your order, be sure to check off the appropriate box at the end of the order form. There are also other racks available for purchase. If you choose to purchase a rack, you may order it directly from R-Wireworks using a credit card or PayPal. Magazine headlines sell themselves, so we recommend that you display them prominently by your checkout counter.</p>
		<p>Look over the title listing and order form and try something new to offer your customers. Once again, be sure to fax or mail back all pages of magazine listing and the credit application completely filled out and signed. If you have any other questions give us a call, we would love to speak with you.</p>
